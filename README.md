## Description

GigWork is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) Stack application that aims to bridge the gap between freelancers and companies/individuals looking to hire for temporary job roles and projects. It provides a platform where freelancers can offer their services, and clients can easily find the right freelancers for their projects.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can register and create their profiles as either freelancers or clients.

- **Posting Freelance Services:** Freelancers can post their services, including a description, skills, and pricing.

- **Service Exploration:** Users can explore a wide range of freelancers and the various services they offer.

- **Real-time Chat:** The application features an end-to-end real-time chat system that enables freelancers and clients to communicate seamlessly.

- **Filter and Pagination:** Users can filter freelancers and services based on criteria and navigate through paginated results.

- **Home and Profile Pages:** The application includes user-friendly home and profile pages for easy navigation and personalization.

## Contributions

My contributions to the project include:

- **Database Design:** I designed the database using MongoDB to efficiently store user profiles, service listings, and chat messages.

- **User Authorization:** Implemented user authorization using web tokens for secure access to the application's features.

- **Middleware Implementation:** Developed middleware to handle various tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

- **End-to-End Real-time Chat:** Implemented a real-time chat system for seamless communication between users.

- **Filter and Pagination Services:** Developed services for filtering and paginating freelancers and services.
